# Student Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores the Student Performance dataset (1000 students, 8 features). The goal is to understand patterns in student scores and the impact of test preparation courses.

## Session 1
- Dataset loaded successfully: 1000 rows, 8 columns, no missing values
- Math, reading, and writing scores strongly correlated
- Test preparation significantly improves scores:
  - Math: +5.6 points
  - Reading: +7.4 points
  - Writing: +9.9 points
- Boxplots confirm higher median and reduced spread for completed test prep
- Outliers exist but main patterns are clear

## Next Steps
- Encode categorical features
- Build regression models for predicting math, reading, and writing scores
- Evaluate model performance
